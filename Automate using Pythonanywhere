To run this code automatically every day:

1. Sign up at [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).
2. Upload `main.py` and `birthdays.csv`. Also, create a directory on the website named exactly `letter_templates`.
3. Inside the `letter_templates` directory, upload the files: `letter_1.txt`, `letter_2.txt`, and `letter_3.txt`.
4. Go to the **Tasks** tab and add a new scheduled task.
5. Set the path to `main.py` and choose the time you want it to run.

**Note:** The file and directory names must match exactly as used in the code, otherwise the script will raise an error.

PythonAnywhere will now run the code daily at the scheduled time.
